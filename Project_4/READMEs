My project for CS1550 the virtual memory simulator

To use:
  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake ../../Project_4
  cmake --build .

To add a file to run put it in the extra directory

Creates 2 executables:

vmsim is used as such:
  vmsim â€“n <numframes> -a <opt|fifo|2nd|nru> [-r <refresh>] <tracefile>
  -n => numframes is the number of frames in physcial memory
  -a => algorithm to choice
  -r => refresh rate, only applicable to nru algorithm.  6 seems to work well
  tracefile => file to parse through

results runs all of the algorithms at 8, 16, 32 and 64 number of frames over two traces and records the results to resutls.csv
